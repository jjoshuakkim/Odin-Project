    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>That recipe was for seafood sundubu-jjigae, which is my favorite, but since then I’ve learned that kimchi-sundubu-jjigae is more popular. This recipe is is for that version, it’s sundubu-jjigae made with kimchi and pork belly, really hard to go wrong with this dish. Whichever one you choose, you won’t be disappointed. Both are delicious, spicy, and savory, much better than anything you can order at a restaurant.</p>
    <p>This recipe serves 1 or two people, but you can double or triple the recipe for more people, and use a large stainless steel or cast iron pot for the cooking. If you want to serve everyone in a ttukbaegi then you’ll need to cook them on multiple burners, just like a restaurant!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tofu</li>
        <li>Pork Belly</li>
        <li>Gochujang</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Spring Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put dried anchovies, radish, dried kelp, and 4 cups of water in a pot. Cover and boil over medium high heat for 10 minutes until it starts boiling.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and boil another 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and strain. It will make about 2 cups of stock.</li>
        <li>Combine the hot pepper flakes and the sesame oil in a small bowl and mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat up a 3 cup earthenware pot (ttukbaegi) on the stove over medium high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes. If you use a small heavy pan or pot, it will take less.</li>
